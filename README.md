raw metabolomics and RT qPCR data are in the csv file - contains not only SCN, but also PLS and LIV metabolites.
Differential expresssion, clustering and rhythm detection needs to be done separately and merged manually with processed data.
External algorithms used: eJTK (https://biodare2.ed.ac.uk/), CircaCompare (modified version included in the script), deseq2 and clustering (RNAlysis).
Individual figures are generated as separate svg files and combined together using Corel Draw or InkScape.
